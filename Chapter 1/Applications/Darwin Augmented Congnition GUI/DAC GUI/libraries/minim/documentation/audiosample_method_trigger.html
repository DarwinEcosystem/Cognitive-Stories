  * This sketch demonstrates how to use the &lt;code>loadSample&lt;/code> method of &lt;code>Minim&lt;/code>. 
  * The &lt;code>loadSample&lt;/code> method allows you to specify the sample you want to load 
  * with a &lt;code>String&lt;/code> and optionally specify what you want the buffer size of the 
  * returned &lt;code>AudioSample&lt;/code> to be. Minim is able to load wav files, au files, aif
  * files, snd files, and mp3 files. When you call &lt;code>loadSample&lt;/code>, if you just 
  * specify the filename it will try to load the sample from the data folder of your sketch. 
  * However, you can also specify an absolute path (such as "C:\foo\bar\thing.wav") and the 
  * file will be loaded from that location (keep in mind that won't work from an applet). 
  * You can also specify a URL (such as "http://www.mysite.com/mp3/song.mp3") but keep in mind 
  * that if you run the sketch as an applet you may run in to security restrictions 
  * if the applet is not on the same domain as the file you want to load. You can get around 
  * the restriction by signing all of the jars in the applet.
  * &lt;p>
  * An &lt;code>AudioSample&lt;/code> is a special kind of file playback that allows
  * you to repeatedly &lt;i>trigger&lt;/i> an audio file. It does this by keeping the
  * entire file in an internal buffer and then keeping a list of trigger points.
  * &lt;code>AudioSample&lt;/code> supports up to 20 overlapping triggers, which
  * should be plenty for short sounds. It is not advised that you use this class
  * for long sounds (like entire songs, for example) because the entire file is
  * kept in memory.
  * &lt;p>
  * Use 'k' and 's' to trigger a kick drum sample and a snare sample, respectively. 
  * You will see their waveforms drawn when they are played back.
  * &lt;p>
  * For more information about Minim and additional features, 
  * visit http://code.compartmental.net/minim/
