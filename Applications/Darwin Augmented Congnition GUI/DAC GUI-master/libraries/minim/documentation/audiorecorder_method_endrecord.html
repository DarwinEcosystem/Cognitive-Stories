  * This sketch demonstrates how to use an AudioRecorder to record audio to disk
  * and then immediately play it back by creating a new FilePlayer using the AudioRecordingStream
  * returned by the save method.
  * &lt;p> 
  * To use this sketch you need to have something plugged into the line-in on your computer.&lt;br/>
  * Press 'r' to toggle recording on and off and the press 's' to save to disk.&lt;br/>
  * The recorded file will be placed in the main folder of the sketch.
  * &lt;p>
