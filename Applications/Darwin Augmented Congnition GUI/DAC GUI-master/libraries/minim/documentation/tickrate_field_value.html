    	The rate that this ticks the UGen patched to it.
 With a rate of 1, the patched UGen 
 will come through normally, but 0.5 will half as fast and sound 
 an octave lower, whereas 2 will be twice as fast and sound an 
 octave higher.

    	<pre>/**
  This is an example of how to use a TickRate UGen to control 
  the tick rate of another UGen, in this case a FilePlayer. &lt;br/>
  A TickRate will tick the UGen patched to it at a rate relative 
  to the normal tick rate. So a TickRate with a value of 1 
  will simply pass the audio. A TickRate with a value of 2 
  will tick the incoming UGen twice as fast as normal. 
  If the value of TickRate is ever set to 0 or lower, 
  it will simply generate silence and not tick its incoming UGen at all. 
  This is because there isn't a way to tell a UGen to tick backwards.
  &lt;p>
  Slide the mouse left and right in the window 
  to control the playback rate of the loop.
  &lt;br/>
  Hold 'i' to make TickRate interpolate between actual sample values 
  (this will remove the "crunch" when at rates less than 1).
