    	Enabled or disable sample interpolation.
 When the rate is less than 1, that means 
 that TickRate will need to generate more 
 output sample frames than it gets from the
 UGen patched to it. With interpolation turned 
 on, it will create these in-between sample frames 
 by interpolating between subsequent sample frames 
 generated by the patched UGen. With interpolation 
 turned off, this simply generates the most recent 
 sample frame generated by the patch UGen until it's 
 time to generate a new one. The result can be "crunchy" 
 sounding, with crunchiness increasing as the rate is reduced.
 Interpolation is turned off be default because TickRate 
 is more computationally expensive with it on.

    	<pre>/**
  This is an example of how to use a TickRate UGen to control 
  the tick rate of another UGen, in this case a FilePlayer. &lt;br/>
  A TickRate will tick the UGen patched to it at a rate relative 
  to the normal tick rate. So a TickRate with a value of 1 
  will simply pass the audio. A TickRate with a value of 2 
  will tick the incoming UGen twice as fast as normal. 
  If the value of TickRate is ever set to 0 or lower, 
  it will simply generate silence and not tick its incoming UGen at all. 
  This is because there isn't a way to tell a UGen to tick backwards.
  &lt;p>
  Slide the mouse left and right in the window 
  to control the playback rate of the loop.
  &lt;br/>
  Hold 'i' to make TickRate interpolate between actual sample values 
  (this will remove the "crunch" when at rates less than 1).
