The OpenBCI GUI relies on the OpenBCIHub.

Always have the OpenBCIHub running before launching the OpenBCI GUI. 

Notes:
You may leave the OpenBCIHub running at all times, and open and close the GUI as needed.
The OpenBCIHub will take up very little memory when not in use
The OpenBCIHub will not use processor time when not in use.
